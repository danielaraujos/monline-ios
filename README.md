# Monline - Monitoria Virtual - iOS

### Abstract
<p>
Monitoring is a very important modality for higher learning. It aims to promote mutual
cooperation between teachers and students and thus help in their difficulties. Although
this approach is very effective, not all students are able to participate in such monitoring,
as they often can not reconcile their activities at the available times. In this context, in
the present work a mobile application was developed that aimed to facilitate the studentâ€™s
interaction with the monitor, so that through the use of technologies they simulated a
face-to-face monitoring. 
Firebase was used, because it has extensive documentation and provides in its free version,
several indispensable resources for the development. The application was developed for
the operating system, using the Swift language and the Xcode tool.
